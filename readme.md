# Dave Runner

This is my version of the well-known T-rex runner game from the infamous 404 page. With a slight twist to the model, where the T-rex is replaced with a friend of mine. All assets were made by me using Piskel, except for the track.

## How to play

Press Space to jump and the S (key) to slide

## Enjoy!
